Task 1: Customer Segmentation for Retail
Objective
Segment customers into groups based on their purchasing behavior using clustering techniques.

Steps:
Data Preparation:

The Customer Segmentation dataset is loaded and cleaned by filtering out irrelevant data.
Total price for each purchase is calculated using Quantity * UnitPrice.
RFM Analysis:

Recency: Number of days since the last purchase.
Frequency: Number of purchases made.
Monetary: Total spending by the customer.
Normalization:

The RFM features are normalized using MinMaxScaler.
Clustering Algorithms:

K-Means Clustering: Applied to segment customers. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
DBSCAN: Density-based clustering applied as an alternative to K-Means.
Visualization:

PCA is used to reduce dimensions to 2D for visualizing the clusters.
The clusters are plotted using matplotlib and seaborn.
Insights:

A summary of the clusters is generated and used to recommend personalized marketing strategies for each group.
Output:
Preprocessed RFM dataset (before and after scaling).
Visualizations of K-Means and DBSCAN clustering.
A CSV file with customer segments.
Dependencies:
pandas
numpy
sklearn
matplotlib
seaborn
Task 2: Air Pollution Forecasting
Objective
Predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for a city using time-series forecasting techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

Steps:
Data Handling:

The Air Quality dataset is loaded and missing values are filled using forward fill method.
The Date and Time columns are combined into a Datetime column and set as the index.
Data Normalization:

The target variable (CO(GT)) is normalized using MinMaxScaler to scale values between 0 and 1.
Feature Engineering:

Sequences of 30 time steps are created for supervised learning using past values to predict future values.
Model Training:

An LSTM model is built using Keras. The model is trained on the training set for 10 epochs.
Evaluation:

The performance of the model is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Prediction and Visualization:

Predictions are made on the test set, and actual vs. predicted values are plotted.
The results are saved into a CSV file.
Output:
Predicted AQI values for the test set.
Actual vs predicted AQI plot.
A CSV file with predicted and actual AQI values.
Dependencies:
pandas
numpy
sklearn
tensorflow
matplotlib
seaborn
How to Run
Task 1: Customer Segmentation
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Place the Customer Segmentation Dataset in the same directory as the code or update the data_path variable.
Run the Python script to preprocess the data, apply clustering, and visualize the results.
Task 2: Air Pollution Forecasting
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib seaborn
Place the Air Quality dataset in the same directory as the code or update the data_path variable.
Run the Python script to preprocess the data, train the LSTM model, and visualize the results.
Conclusion
Both tasks provide hands-on experience with machine learning techniques:

Task 1 focuses on unsupervised learning for customer segmentation using K-Means and DBSCAN.
Task 2 covers time-series forecasting using LSTM for air pollution prediction.
